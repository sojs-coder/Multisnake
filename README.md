# Why this was made
MultiSnake was really a challenge for me. I wanted to create a game, but I did not want to use any pre-made game engine or canvas.

So I made my own.

All graphics you see are done with HTML table, using the background-color property. The apple is an emoji. 

Over 1.5K lines of javascript code, over 350 of CSS, and just about 200 HTML lines, this project has a whopping total of over 2K lines of code. 

This is not counting grahpics which took me a long time to make.

No changelog here... join the [discord](https://discord.gg/Np7vBvEtp2) to be the first to know when a new one comes out. I roll out an update every week or so.
